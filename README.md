This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The app is a simple game of checkers with an AI opponent.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser (although it should open automatically).
